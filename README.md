# 8-bit-computer-CPU-design
A CPU design for the 8-bit computer using VHDL.
The main parts of the CPU are:

 Markup : *  Logic and computing unit that is used to perform logical and computing operations.
          * ÙŽ  Register that provides operands to the ALU and stores the results of operations.
          *  Control unit that directs operations. It instructs the memory, logic unit, and both output and input devices of the computer on how to respond to the program's instructions.
Here a simple computer has been implemented. Its main parts are:
Markup  : * Control Unit
          * Memory
          * Computing Unit
The schema is as follows:
