# 8-bit-computer-CPU-design
A CPU design for the 8-bit computer using VHDL.
The main parts of the CPU are:

* Logic and computing unit that is used to perform logical and computing operations.
* ÙŽRegister that provides operands to the ALU and stores the results of operations.
* Control unit that directs operations. It instructs the memory, logic unit, and both output and input devices of the computer on how to respond to the program's instructions.
  
A simple CPU has been implemented here. Its main parts are control unit, memory and computing unit.
The schema is as follows:

Test results, implemention of this CPU using a state machine and more description are availabe on [Description.pdf](https://github.com/nikimajidifard/8-bit-computer-CPU-design/files/12773108/Description.pdf) (fa).
